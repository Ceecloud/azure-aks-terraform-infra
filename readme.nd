# Azure Kubernetes Infrastructure with Terraform

This project demonstrates the design and provisioning of a production-style Azure Kubernetes infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Overview

The infrastructure is built using Terraform and follows DevOps best practices, including automated provisioning, version control, and modular design.

It includes:
- Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and subnets
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions
- Remote state management with Terraform Cloud
- NGINX Ingress Controller
- cert-manager for TLS/SSL certificate management

## Architecture

The diagram below shows the high-level architecture of the infrastructure.
